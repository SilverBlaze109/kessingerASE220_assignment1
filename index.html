                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>I was raised in Louisa, Kentucky and went to school their until my junior year of high school. During my junior and senior years, I attended the Craft Academy for Excellence in Mathematics and Science, a dual-credit school where I would take classes at Morehead State University. After graduating, I began attending Northern Kentucky University.</p>
                <p>I graduated from the Craft Academy with Honors with Distinction due to my high grades and community service. I am currently enrolled in the honors program at NKU, and I have created an Artificial Intelligence to generate music as part of a research project for the honors college.</p>

                <h1>Skills</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adaptability - Every since beginning to study at the Craft Academy, I have had to quickly change my process for approaching problems depending on the class. This skill was especially useful for my various Computer Science courses which forced me to change my way of thinking in order to solve various problems quickly.</li>
                    <li>Problem Solving - Similar to Adaptability, my college courses have forced me to develop my problem solving skills. My Science and Mathematic courses taught me how to quickly break down a problem into its core components to solve it quickly. My Computer Science courses have taught me to use my developed problem solving skills to create algorithms that computers can follow to solve a variety of problems.</li>
                    <li>Communication Skills - Through my college and high school experience, I have had to interact and work with people from a variety of backgrounds. I have completed numerous group projects including creating a mobile game app and improving a wikipedia style website.</li>
                </ul>

            <div id="hobby" class="container section">
                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy taking walks around NKU's campus. I particularly enjoy walking around the lake. I commonly see various groups of geese swimming or walking around. I usually take a walk right after I finish classes and late at night. My late night walks are a nice way to wind down after a long day, and it allows me to reflect on my day.</p>
                <p>I also enjoy playing games with my friends. I usually play Dungeons and Dragons or Magic: the Gathering with them. Dungeons and Dragons (Dnd) is a tabletop roleplaying game where a Dungeon Master creates a world, and the other players roleplay as characters in the world to explore it or do quests. I usually play as the Dungeon Master, so I also write different locations that my players can explore and characters for my players to talk to.</p>
                <p>Recently, many of my friends have begun playing Magic: the Gathering (Mtg). Mtg is card game where the players create decks from various cards and fight each other with their decks. Different cards in Mtg can summon monsters or draw cards.. I have played mtg for a long time so I am teaching them how to play the game. They are quickly learning and have begun to change their decks to align with more of what they want.</p>
